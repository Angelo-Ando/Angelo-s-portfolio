                                On the second day in Baguio, I was ill. Actually I had been feeling woozy the past six days of the tour.
                                I neglected my health to enjoy the moment. My throat was sore and head aching a little. However it 
                                was on April 13 that I decided to stay in the hotel and rest. I wanted to have fun as everyone else
                                 but unfortunately I wasn't in the mood. But I don't regret that decision as my health slowly improved. 
                                 I spent half of the day chilling in my hotel room, laying in bed, watching TV and taking medicines until 
                                 it was time to pack up and return to Manila.
